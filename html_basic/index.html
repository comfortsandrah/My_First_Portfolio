    <h3>Tell us about yourself</h3>
    <p>
      I have developed and demonstrated an ability to manage projects and lead
      teams, preparing for future leadership roles in technology and management
      My passion for design and building applications has cultivated a deep
      interest in working with both front-end and back-end web technologies. I
      am proficient in various programming languages and frameworks, including
      Python, JavaScript, Dart with Flutter, React, Tailwind CSS, and
      TypeScript. This breadth of technical expertise allows me to tackle a wide
      variety of software development challenges with confidence and efficiency.

    <p>
      I have also honed a set of valuable soft skills that contribute to my
      overall professional competence; leadership skills, teamwork, grit,
      critical thinking, analytical thinking, and problem-solving skills. As an
      aspiring full-stack developer, I am drawn to the opportunity to work
      across the entire software development lifecycle, from the front-end user
      experience to the back-end infrastructure. I would bring a unique
      combination of technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and a
      customer-centric mindset to any client or employer's day-to-day business
      operations.
